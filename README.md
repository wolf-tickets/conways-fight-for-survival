# conways-fight-for-survival

In this reimagining of John Conway's famous cellular automaton, several players fight to be the last cell standing in the primordial ooze!

The logic of Conway's original Game of Life is mostly intact, but with an added competitive multiplayer aspect, where players can deploy their cells and then watch what happens as through several iterations of the automaton before having an opportunity to deploy reinforcements.
